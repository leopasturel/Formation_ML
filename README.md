Projects done during my OpenClassrooms formation as a Machine Learning Engineer

Here you will find different projects that I have done during my formation. Feel free to browse! :)
My codes were initially done in Spyder using Python 3.9 before I exported them in a Notebook format.


* PROJECT 2 *
In project 2, we had to prepare a dataset in order to create an application of our choice for public health.
I could not add the first datasets into my repository since they were too big.
Here is the link to download the raw dataset on openfoondfacts.org: https://static.openfoodfacts.org/data/en.openfoodfacts.org.products.csvhttps://static.openfoodfacts.org/data/en.openfoodfacts.org.products.csv
